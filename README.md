# Breast_Cancer_Classification-Pytorchand Dense-Neural-Network
This repository contains an end-to-end solution for classifying breast cancer into malignant or benign categories using a Dense Neural Network (DNN). The project leverages deep learning techniques to process breast cancer diagnostic data and predict the nature of a tumor based on its features. 
# Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve outcomes for patients. This project uses a deep learning-based Dense Neural Network to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant, providing a fast and reliable alternative to traditional diagnostic methods.

The dataset used contains features extracted from breast mass cell nuclei present in digitized images of Fine Needle Aspirates (FNA) of breast tissue. The dataset includes numeric characteristics of the cell nuclei.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Framework: Pytorch
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations)
Scikit-learn (for preprocessing and evaluation)

# Results
The Dense Neural Network achieves high accuracy and performs well in distinguishing between benign and malignant cases. The visualization of model performance and predictions ensures interpretability and reliability.
